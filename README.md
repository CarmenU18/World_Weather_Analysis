# World_Weather_Analysis

The following adjustments are made to the code to include:

1. The description of the weather in our data. 
2. Filtering the information based on weather preferences.
3.  Identify possible travel destinations, as well as nearby hotels. 
4. Once the possible destinations have been decided, create a travel itinerary. 
5.  Using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel itinerary was created between the four chosen cities, as well as a layered map of markers.
